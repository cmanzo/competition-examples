Basic competition bundles
=========================

Examples of competitions directed to beginning organizers.

* Yellow world - the simplest possible example of result submission competition.

* Compute pi - the simplest possible example of code submission competition.

* Iris - an example of Kaggle-style competition with result or code submission, which was generated by the Chalab wizard.

* Iris MRRtest - the IRIS competition as above, but with a modified leaderboard used to test the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) operation over competition metrics (Prediction Score and Duration).

* GPU Test - a example that runs `nvidia-smi` and `torch.cuda.is_available()` to check if GPU workers are working.
